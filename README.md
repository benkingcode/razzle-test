WIP demo of a React app that has code splitting, server-side rendering and data-fetching components with rehydration.

Based off [Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle).

Recommended you try navigating by route with `Fast 3G` network throttling so you can see what is happening with the lazy loading and data loading steps, and also try navigating with JavaScript disabled to see the data pre-fetching on the server in action.

# Running

`yarn start`
